## Brief Description

This repository contains two [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks
containing [Julia](https://julialang.org/) code.
- `notebooks/grid_oscillations__used.ipynb`
  Here, grid oscillations associated to nullspace consistent
  first derivative summation by parts (SBP) operators are visualised.
  The corresponding figures in the article can be reproduced using
  this code and interactive experiments are set up.
- `notebooks/projections__used.ipynb`
  Here, a discrete Helmholtz Hodge decomposition using classical
  finite difference SBP operators is conducted for several parameters.
  Besides visualisations of the decomposition in two and three space
  dimensions, convergence studies and applications to wave mode
  analysis of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations are presented.
  This notebook contains the code for all other numerical examples
  and figures in the article.
